# My Recipe Book

![Home Page](./src/assets/images/homepage_screenshot.png)

My Recipe Book is a full-stack web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete recipes. The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js and Express.js for the backend. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **View Recipes**: Browse through all the recipes available in the application. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
- **Add Recipes**: Add your favorite recipes to the application. Include a title, a list of ingredients, and instructions for others to follow.
- **Edit Recipes**: Make changes to the recipes you have added. Whether you want to add an extra ingredient or modify the instructions, the application provides you the flexibility to edit your recipes as you see fit.
- **Delete Recipes**: Remove any recipes that you no longer want in the application. Just a simple click and the recipe will be deleted from the application.

## Usage

First, clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-recipe-book.git
